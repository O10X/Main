# Welcome to the O10X Kodi Arcive

This Repo has the Final Install Files for Fen and Fen-Light with the RD and AD Fixes (and additonal Debrid Providers for Fen Lite) In addition it has the unoffical Update for Seren 

I Might Add installers for POV and Umbrella, but as there repository is still in existatance Please use the Repository File, as you will automatically update that way.

Repository Files that I find Useful IE Umbrella, POV, Cocoscrapers, Nixgates, etc are also added here as I need them

Enjoy
